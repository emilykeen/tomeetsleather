               <h4>Coming off hot weeks Andrew and Tommy make some bold picks, and Logan is here too. Army has a big game at home with hopes for a commander and chief game against Navy at the end of the year if they can beat Air Force at home in West Point. can Kentucky’s hopes of winning the east stay alive this week? probably not, but that won’t stop us from picking against Georgia. Nebraska, Wisconsin, Penn State, and Ohio State are all looking to have big games this week to keep their dream of battling in the Big 10 championship alive. Finally Alabama stares down a rejuvenated LSU team on the road. Will LSU succeed in pulling a historic upset, or will the Tide Roll. Tune in to hear our thoughts.</h4>

Arkansas has to beat Auburn, because I refuse to believe that Auburn is a talented team. Wisconsin gets another game where it must prove itself, this time against a struggling Iowa. Boise and Western Michigan look to remain undefeated. Louisville tries to avoid another potential upset, this week facing down NC State. Finally… Is Logan seriously picking Texas A&M to win against Bama?
